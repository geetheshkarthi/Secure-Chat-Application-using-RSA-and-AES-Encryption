# Secure-Chat-Application-using-RSA-and-AES-Encryption
This project implements a basic encrypted chat system between a server and multiple clients using a hybrid encryption approach. RSA is used for securely exchanging AES keys, and AES (CBC mode) is used for fast, secure message encryption. The server handles multiple clients with threading, ensuring secure communication across all connections.
